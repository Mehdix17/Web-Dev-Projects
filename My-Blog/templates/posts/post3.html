          Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables
          machines to learn from data and improve over time without being
          explicitly programmed. By analyzing patterns in large datasets, ML
          algorithms can make predictions, detect anomalies, and even generate
          content.

          Common applications of machine learning include spam detection, fraud
          prevention, facial recognition, and recommendation systems. Tools like
          TensorFlow and scikit-learn make it easier than ever for developers to
          build intelligent applications. However, the quality of data and the
          interpretability of models remain ongoing challenges.
