          AI plays a critical role in modern cybersecurity. Machine learning
          models can detect suspicious network behavior, flag phishing emails,
          and automate incident response. These tools help organizations stay
          ahead of rapidly evolving cyber threats.

          However, AI can also be used by malicious actors. Deepfakes, automated
          hacking tools, and AI-powered social engineering are becoming new
          fronts in the cybersecurity war. As defenses get smarter, so do the
          attacks — making cybersecurity a race against time and technology.
