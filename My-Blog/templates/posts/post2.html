          Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems.
          It involves understanding algorithms, data structures, software
          engineering, programming languages, artificial intelligence, and much
          more. At its core, computer science is about problem-solving — using
          logic and creativity to build systems that help people and businesses
          work smarter.
