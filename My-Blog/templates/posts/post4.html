          Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving
          problems. In computer science, they are the building blocks of any
          program. Whether you're sorting a list, searching for a value, or
          compressing data, there's an algorithm behind the scenes making it
          happen.

          Efficient algorithms are essential for optimizing performance,
          especially in applications that handle large volumes of data. Classic
          algorithms like QuickSort, Dijkstraâ€™s, and A* have become foundational
          in both academic learning and real-world programming.
