          Artificial Intelligence is transforming healthcare by enabling faster
          diagnosis, personalized treatments, and predictive analytics.
          AI-powered tools can analyze medical images, detect tumors, and
          forecast patient deterioration, often with greater accuracy than
          humans.

          Startups and major tech companies are collaborating with hospitals to
          integrate AI into radiology, pathology, and patient care. While
          promising, challenges remain in terms of data privacy, algorithm bias,
          and ensuring accountability in life-critical applications.
